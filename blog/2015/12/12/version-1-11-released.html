          </h3>
          <hr>
            <p>Bundler 1.11 is here! Six and a half months after the last big release, we’re
            finally ready to ship 1.11.</p>
            
            <p>I know it’s been a while, but there’s a pretty good reason for that. Over the
            summer, the team was busy supervising <em>four</em> Google Summer of Code students:</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>We made a significant amount of progress on the new compact gem index, which
            ought to ship in 1.12 in the near future.</li>
              <li>We improved the Bundler website and online documentation.</li>
              <li>We’ve created a solid base for Bundler 2.0.</li>
              <li>We prototyped a new plugin system.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>In addition, the Bundler Core team has spent a lot of time focusing on the
            development experience of bundler itself. The bundler codebase is over five
            years old, and contains code from over 400 contributors. That can make it
            rather daunting to start contributing, and also makes it hard to ensure that
            all of the code in bundler is up to the same standards (and is fit to last for
            the next five years!). In order to make things more consistent, we’ve
            introduced RuboCop (and thus a style guide), we’ve instituted a build bot to
            ensure that <code>master</code> is never failing, and have decided to subject 100% of the
            new code introduced to code review. This is a big step forward, and lets me
            confidently say that this will be our best release yet!</p>
            
            <p>That out of the way, what’s actually in this long-awaited release?</p>
            
            <h3 id="new-features">New features</h3>
            
            <p>First up, we’ve combed through a few years worth of bundler issues, and have
            improved the error messaging for every single one of them. Our goal is to never
            show an exception with a backtrace, and instead present a friendly and helpful
            error message when things go awry – and we’re now pretty close to that.</p>
            
            <p>The dependency resolver has also seen a few updates. Continuing the theme of
            improved errors, version conflicts will now do a better job of reporting what
            versions of every gem have been activated, making it even easier to figure out
            the best way to resolve said conflict. Additionally, resolution has been sped up
            by over 25x in pathological cases. That’s a pretty nice win.</p>
            
            <p>Finally, we’ve laid the groundwork for resolving gems based on the current
            version of Ruby.  Once the new index is rolled out, Bundler will make sure to
            choose gems whose <code>required_ruby_version</code> matches the Ruby you are running on.</p>
            
            <h3 id="bugfixes">Bugfixes</h3>
            
            <p>The real meat of this release comes in the bugfix section, however. Across
            almost four hundred commits, we’ve squashed upwards of fifty unique bugs.
            Meaning this version of bundler should be the fastest, most stable version we’ve
            ever released.</p>
            
            <h3 id="whats-next">What’s Next</h3>
            
            <p>As I mentioned earlier, this long gap between releases doesn’t mean we’re
            slowing down development – quite the opposite, in fact! We’re actively working
            on bundler 1.12 and 2.0 <em>at this very moment</em>, and are incredibly exited to get
            the new index into people’s hands as fast as we possibly can.</p>
            
            <h4 id="updating">Updating</h4>
            
            <p>To install the last release of Bundler, you can run:</p>
            
            <p><code>&#x000A;$ [sudo] gem install bundler</code></p>
